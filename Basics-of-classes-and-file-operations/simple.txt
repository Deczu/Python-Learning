Marta tries very hard to combine coding with passion for science, cooking and dancing. In her free time she walks on stilts and makes balloon animals for children. Wants to own a restaurant some day. She is and always will be the optimist. The hoper of far-flung hopes, the dreamer of improbable dreams. She believes in people and that sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles.
